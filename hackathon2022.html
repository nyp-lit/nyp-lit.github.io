              <li>
                You may reuse code from previous projects for specific
                components. However, recycling an entire project or the majority
                of the project is not allowed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Plagiarism of someone else‚Äôs code will result in

              </li>
              <li>
                Frameworks/libraries/open-source code can be used in your

                your write-up.
              </li>
              <li>

            <h3>Participants‚Äô Code Of Conduct</h3>
            <ul>

                We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any

              <li>
                LiT is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event for
                everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation,
                disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality,
                religion, or coding experience level (or lack of the

              </li>
              <li>
                You may not code anything that violates the code of conduct. For
                example, racially insensitive content in a website will be
                automatically disqualified.
